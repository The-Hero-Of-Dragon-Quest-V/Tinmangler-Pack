# Tinmangler-Pack
For Tinmangler on Tinkercad mostly, but theres some things that need fixing:
Sapphire Wand doesnt appear and doesnt work, mostly because of advice from Copilot and Chat GPT...
Sapphire Shard Progectiles sound like arrows and stick to the ground for a bit, and are hitable.
As far as I can tell those are the only glitches, but its been a while so I dunno.
